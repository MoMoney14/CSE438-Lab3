CREATIVE PORTION
1. What you implemented?
I implemented a feature that allows users to capture and save their drawings onto the camera roll. Users can draw whatever they want and at any given moment, they can choose to save the drawings to the camera roll. Another feature I implemented was the ability to change the opacity of the drawings. With the opacity controller, one could set it all the way to 0 to potentially use it as an eraser. I also added an animation feature that moves the picture left and right.

2. How you implemented it?
I implemented the save feature by converting the view that the users draw on into a UIImageView and saving it into the camera roll using a built in apple function called UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum. I implemented the opacity feature by creating a more button in the toolbar which displays a UISlider where the user can move around to change the opacity. I implemented the animation feature by creating an animate button when the more button is pressed. If the animate button is pressed, the animate function under the UIView class allows the picture to move back and forth.

3. Why you implemented it?
I implemented the save feature because users should be able to have the opportunity to create something they like and save it to remember the occasion they drew the drawing. Its also entertaining for the user to be able to scroll through their saved history of images and look back on the drawings. I implemented the opacity functionality because it allows for more color variation for the users in terms of the different shades of color. It allows users to make a more diverse drawing. I implemented the animate function to allow users to see their drawings in motion and give it a more "lively" appearance.
